# Access Management System using Face Recognition

## Overview
The **Access Management System using Face Recognition** is a Python-based application that utilizes facial recognition technology to authenticate users. The system allows users to log in through facial recognition and register new users with their images. The GUI is implemented using Tkinter, and the face recognition process leverages the `face_recognition` library.

## Features
- **Face-Based Authentication:** Users can log in by scanning their faces.
- **New User Registration:** Allows new users to register their faces in the system.
- **Real-Time Webcam Integration:** Captures live images for authentication and registration.
- **Simple GUI:** Built using Tkinter for ease of use.
- **Logging:** Maintains a log of successful logins with timestamps.
